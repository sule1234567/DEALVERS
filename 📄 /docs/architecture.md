# 🧱 DEALVERSE — Technical Architecture

## ⚙️ Overview
DEALVERSE is built as a modular Web3 application with 4 core layers:
1. **Frontend (User Interface)**
2. **Backend (API & Business Logic)**
3. **Blockchain Layer (Smart Contracts)**
4. **Database Layer (Off-chain Data Storage)**

---

## 🧩 1. Frontend
**Technology:** React + TailwindCSS  
**Purpose:** Provide a seamless and interactive experience for users.  

### Components:
- **Landing Page:** Explains the platform’s value proposition and guides users to sign up.  
- **User Dashboard:** Displays verified deals, analytics, and wallet connection.  
- **Merchant Dashboard:** Allows businesses to create & manage deals.  
- **NFT Deal Viewer:** View, list, and trade deal NFTs.  

---

## ⚡ 2. Backend
**Technology:** Node.js + Express.js  
**Purpose:** Handle all requests, authentication, and smart contract interactions.  

### Features:
- RESTful API endpoints for user management and deals.  
- Integration with Solana RPC or Anchor framework.  
- Middleware for authentication, validation, and request logging.  
- Rate-limiting and security middleware (Helmet, CORS).  

---

## 🔗 3. Blockchain Layer
**Technology:** Solana Smart Contracts (Rust)  

### Smart Contract Responsibilities:
- Minting and managing **NFT Deal Coupons**  
- Storing metadata (discount %, expiry, merchant ID, usage limits)  
- Handling ownership transfers (buy, sell, gift)  
- Verification and redemption logic  

### Integration Tools:
- Solana Web3.js (frontend connection)  
- Anchor framework for contract testing and deployment  

---

## 🗄️ 4. Database Layer
**Technology:** MongoDB (off-chain storage)  

### Data Stored:
- User profiles & merchant details  
- Off-chain analytics data  
- Deal metadata (cached from blockchain)  
- Transaction history for dashboards  

---

## 🔐 5. Authentication & Security
- **Wallet Login (Phantom / Solflare)** using Solana Web3  
- **JWT-based authentication** for user sessions  
- **Smart contract verification** for ownership and transaction signing  
- **Encryption** for sensitive off-chain data  

---

## 🌍 6. Deployment
- **Frontend:** Vercel or Netlify  
- **Backend:** Render or AWS  
- **Smart Contracts:** Solana Devnet → Mainnet  
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas  

---

## 🔄 7. Workflow Summary
1. User connects wallet → logs in  
2. Merchant creates deal → backend calls smart contract → mints NFT  
3. NFT coupon stored on-chain → metadata synced to MongoDB  
4. User can view, buy, or trade deals on frontend marketplace  
5. Redemption verified via QR or wallet signature  

---

## 🧠 8. Scalability Plan
- Microservice-based backend structure  
- Future integration with Layer 2 and cross-chain NFT protocols  
- DAO governance and token-based voting system
