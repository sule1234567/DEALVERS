## 💢 2. Problem Statement  
Traditional discount and deal platforms (like Groupon) are **centralized**, **non-transferable**, and **untrustworthy**.  
Users lose ownership of their coupons, while merchants have no transparent way to track redemption.  
There’s **no real liquidity or on-chain verification** for global deal promotions.

---

## 💡 3. Our Solution: DEALVERSE  
**DEALVERSE** transforms the way people discover, own, and trade deals using **Web3 + NFT technology**.  
Every deal or discount becomes a **verifiable, tradable NFT coupon**, giving users **ownership**, **transferability**, and **cross-platform use**.

### Core Concept  
> “Every coupon becomes a collectible NFT — tradable, verifiable, and global.”
